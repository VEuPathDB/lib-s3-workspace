= S3 Workspaces

A thin wrapper library around https://github.com/VEuPathDB/lib-s34k[S34K] treating an S3 object store as a remote
filesystem.

== Workspaces

Workspaces are directories keyed on a https://github.com/VEuPathDB/lib-hash-id[HashID] which contain files and
sub-workspaces relevant to a specific job.

NOTE: As S3 stores have no concept of directories, workspaces are marked with a special file named `.workspace`.
This file is kept at the root of a workspace.  This library uses the workspace marker file to simulate directory and
file operations.
